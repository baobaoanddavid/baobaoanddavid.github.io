The best gift you can give us is your presence at our wedding. However, if you would like to honor us with a gift, we would be grateful for your contribution to our future together.

We have a cash wedding registry through Zola: www.zola.com/registry/baobaoanddavid

In Chinese wedding traditions, gifting cash in red envelopes is a cherished custom symbolizing good fortune, prosperity, and unity. Cash gifts help the newlyweds build their future together and provide practical support for starting their new life. This tradition reflects a deep appreciation for family and communal well-being, where each guest contributes to the coupleâ€™s shared dreams.
